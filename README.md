# toDoList
📝 Task List – React Project This is my first React project, built as part of my Front-End course at DevClub. It's a simple and functional to-do list app that helped me solidify core concepts while exploring React's component-based structure. 🚀 Technologies Used: - React (functional components and state handling) - Styled Components (CSS-in-JS styling) - React Icons (icon integration for UI) - Google Fonts (custom typography) - HTML & CSS embedded within JSX components ✨ Features: - Add new tasks to the list - Dynamic interface feedback when the list is empty - Modern, responsive design with motivational touches This project gave me hands-on experience working with component logic and styling in React. I'm excited to keep learning and building more!
