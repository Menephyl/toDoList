# 📝 Task List - React Project

This is my **first React project**, developed during my Front-End training at [DevClub](https://devclub.com.br). It's a simple and responsive to-do list app that helped me understand the foundations of component-based development in React.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React**
- **Styled Components**
- **React Icons**
- **Google Fonts**
- **HTML & CSS within JSX components**

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Add and remove tasks
- ✅ Conditional interface (shows message when there are no tasks)
- ✅ Custom styling with Styled Components
- ✅ Responsive design

## 💡 What I Learned

This project helped me practice:
- Using **functional components** and managing **state** with `useState`
- Creating custom-styled components with Styled Components
- Importing and applying **React Icons** and **Google Fonts**
- Handling **component composition** and **props**
- Writing clean and organized JSX

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
